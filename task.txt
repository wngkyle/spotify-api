Hi Kyle, as a test of your technical skills can you please build a Spotify web app with React? 
The app should allow a user to log into their account via the web app. It should also show the 
users's playlists and play individual songs or the playlists. Don't worry about making the UI 
pretty. I'm more concerned with how well your app works and how the code looks.
